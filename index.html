        <p><strong>Whats the weather like out there? We mean waaaay out there in our solar system <br> where the forecast might
            not be quite what you think.
            Lets <br> look at the mean temperature of the Sun, and the planets in our solar system.<br> The mean
            temperature is the average temperature over the surface of the rocky planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and
            Mars. <br> Dwarf planet Pluto also has a solid surface. But since the gas giants donâ€™t have a surface, the
            mean is the average temperature at  what would be equivalent at sea level on Earth</strong><img
